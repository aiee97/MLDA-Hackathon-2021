HOW TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM

1. Run the 'main.py' script in UI folder
2. When the UI appears, input the desired text to be tested and click "Filter Spam"
3. The UI will display the prediction telling if the text is spam or not spam
4. Click the "correct" or "wrong" button to tell the program if the predict is correct or not, and allow the program to retrain itself on the new data. Click "Next Message" to input the next message without retraining the model.
